                 I graduated from AAST with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering.
My skills in front-end development include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and WordPress.<br/></p>
<p>I also know other languages, as I have knowledge in game development and other computer science fields like,
 computer networks, machine learning and data acquisition. (C#, Python, Java, C, MySQL) </p>
However, my focus right now is on Front-End Development. The projects and skills I will be displaying on my website 
will be focused towards Front-End Development.
I'm passionate about creating beautiful, user-friendly web applications.
